# Vehicle-AccidentYoloApp

## üöó About the Project

**Vehicle-AccidentYoloApp** is a **YOLO-based application** used for **vehicle and accident detection** from video or in **real-time**. This application can identify various types of vehicles, calculate vehicle speed, and provide alerts when an accident is detected.

This project is deployed **locally** on the user's device to avoid high costs of renting online GPU resources.

## üîß How to Use

1. **Select detection mode**:
    - **Image Detection**: Processes image input.
    - **Video Detection**: Processes all frames from the input video for more accurate results.
    - **Real-Time Detection**: Uses screen recording (OBS Virtual Camera) for live detection with limited FPS based on device capability.
2. **Input an image, video, or turn on the webcam**.
3. **The application will display detection results, vehicle speed (Video or Real-Time Detection), and accident alerts (Video or Real-Time Detection)** if detected.
4. **Speed and accident data will be recorded in a report (xlsx file)**.

## ‚ö° Feature Differences: Video vs. Real-Time Detection

-   **Video Detection**:
    -   Processes all frames in the video.
    -   More accurate speed estimation.
    -   Longer processing time.
-   **Real-Time Detection**:
    -   Processes fewer frames (on this device only 11.364 FPS).
    -   Faster due to frame skipping.
    -   Speed estimation accuracy is lower compared to video detection.

## üìå Notes

This application is **deployed locally** because running vehicle and accident detection models requires **high GPU resources**, which would be expensive if done online.
